Creating a new repository on github
git remote

git remote add origin [url from github]

git remote -v

git push origin master


Syncing the remote with local:

git pull origin master


Forking an online repository
Allows you to refer to someone else's project but then also create your own version that you can edit and commit, etc


If you clone a git project into the wrong folder, using rm -rf [directory] will remove it and you can reclone.  Apparently one can also just move the directory but I wasn't able to figure that out
