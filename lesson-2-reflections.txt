You need to initiate a repository so that git knows that the folder is being tracked, and so that you can define what is being tracked


useful commands

git reset (resets the staging area added to by git add so that you can change what you want to commit)
actually, my initial understanding was wrong.  git reset keeps the file in the commit but resets it to the last commit

git diff (with no arguments, compares the version in the working directory with the latest commit, contained in the staging area)

git diff --stage (allows you to compare the staged version to repository before committing)

git reset --hard (dangerous, but discards changes in working directory or staging areas)

git branch displays branches
you can checkout a branch just like you can checkout a past commit
