useful is grep to find commit id's
git log --stat -i --grep=[string]

using diff is counter intuitive...you pick the new file second

It will be easier to break things if I can easily go back and forth between files!

custom configs
show current checked out commit


I want to use git for the program that I'm planning to make

.git is the metadata in each git repository

ls -a gets hidden files too

useful commands
git status
git add (adds files to be tracked when you have that folder tracked by git)
